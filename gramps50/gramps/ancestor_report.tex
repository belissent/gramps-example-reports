% We use latin1 encoding at a minimum by default.
% GRAMPS uses unicode UTF-8 encoding for its
% international support. LaTeX can deal gracefully
% with unicode encoding by using the ucs style invoked
% when utf8 is specified as an option to the inputenc
% package. This package is included by default in some
% installations, but not in others, so we do not make it
% the default.  Uncomment the first line if you wish to use it
% (If you do not have ucs.sty, you may obtain it from
%  http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/unicode/)
