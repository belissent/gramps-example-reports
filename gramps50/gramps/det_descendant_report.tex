% with unicode encoding by using the ucs style invoked
% when utf8 is specified as an option to the inputenc
% package. This package is included by default in some
% installations, but not in others, so we do not make it
% the default.  Uncomment the first line if you wish to use it
% (If you do not have ucs.sty, you may obtain it from
%  http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/unicode/)

  We have committed to synergistically disseminate resource-leveling methods of empowerment to set us apart from the competition. We envision to globally integrate inexpensive paradigms and professionally engineer timely technology while promoting personal employee growth. Our mission is to assertively build world-class methods of empowerment so that we may professionally promote parallel services to set us apart from the competition. It's our responsibility to dramatically maintain value-added services as well as to professionally simplify principle-centered technology for 100\% customer satisfaction.~\newline
