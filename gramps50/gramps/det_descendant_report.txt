      you store data of genealogische to draw for above and 
      investigating. GRAMPS tries to make all the general capacities 
      available of other programs of genealogischer more importantly 
      but, to put an additional capacity of integration at your service 
      not generally for these programs. This one is the capacity to 
      directly incorporate all the possible pieces of the information in
      Gramps and the cases of the data cambiar/manipulateany/all in the 
      whole data base (in any order or order) around the user to
