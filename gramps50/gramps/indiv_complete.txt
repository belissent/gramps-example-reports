GRAMPS aid to look for its tree to him of family. It allows that you 
store data of genealogische to draw for above and investigating. GRAMPS
tries to make all the general capacities available of other programs of
genealogischer more importantly but, to put an additional capacity of 
integration at your service not generally for these programs. This one 
is the capacity to directly incorporate all the possible pieces of the 
information in Gramps and the cases of the data 
cambiar/manipulateany/all in the whole data base (in any order or 
order) around the user to support, if it makes the investigation, 
analysis and interrelation with the potential of the distances of the 
relation that fill.
